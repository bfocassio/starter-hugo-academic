abstract = "New techniques to manipulate the electronic properties of few layer 2D materials, unveiling new physical phenomena as well as possibilities for new device applications have brought renewed interest to these systems. Therefore, the quest for reproducible methods for the large scale synthesis, as well as the manipulation, characterization and deeper understanding of these structures is a very active field of research. We here report the production of nitrogen doped bilayer graphene in a fast single step (2.5 minutes), at reduced temperatures (760â€‰C) using microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MW-PECVD). Raman spectroscopy confirmed that nitrogen-doped bilayer structures were produced by this method. XPS analysis showed that we achieved control of the concentration of nitrogen dopants incorporated into the final samples. We have performed state of the art parameter-free simulations to investigate the cause of an unexpected splitting of the XPS signal as the concentration of nitrogen defects increased. We show that this splitting is due to the formation of interlayer bonds mediated by nitrogen defects on the layers of the material. The occurrence of these bonds may result in very specific electronic and mechanical properties of the bilayer structures."
